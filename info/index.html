	<h1>1. Better Water Management</h1><br>
	The first step in water management is the selection of the right crops. Local crops that are more adaptable to the weather conditions of the region are selected. Crops that do not demand too much water must be chosen for dry areas.
	There should be well-planned irrigation systems; otherwise, other issues like river depletion, dry land and soil degradation will develop.
	The application of rainwater harvesting systems by storing rainwater can be used in drought prevailing conditions. Apart from that, municipal wastewater can be used for irrigation after recycling.
		<br><br>
	<h1>2. Soil Enrichment</h1><br>
	Soil is a central component of agricultural ecosystems. Healthy soil is full of life, which can often be killed by the overuse of pesticides. Good soils can increase yields as well as help create more robust crops
	It is possible to maintain and enhance the quality of the soil in many ways. Some examples include leaving half crop residue in the field after a harvest, and the use of composted plant material or animal manure.Next time leaving the other half residue for some months.
		<br><br>
	<h1>3. Cover Crops</h1><br>
	Many farmers choose to have crops planted in a field at all times and never leave it barren; this can cause unintended consequences. By planting cover crops, such as clover or oats, the farmer can achieve his goals of preventing soil erosion, suppressing the growth of weeds, and enhancing the quality of the soil. The use of cover crops also reduces the need for chemicals such as fertilizers.
		
	<h1>4. Crop Rotation</h1><br>
	Crop rotation is one of the most powerful techniques of sustainable agriculture. Its purpose is to avoid the consequences that come with planting the same crops in the same soil for years in a row. It helps tackle pest problems, as many pests prefer specific crops. If the pests have a steady food supply, they can greatly increase their population size.
	Rotation breaks the reproduction cycles of pests. During rotation, farmers can plant certain crops, which replenish plant nutrients. These crops reduce the need for chemical fertilizers.
		<br><br>
	<h1>5. Sustainable Development</h1><br>
	Sustainable development has a alot of benefits.It Contributes to Environmental Conservation.The environment plays a huge role in fulfilling our basic needs to sustain life. In turn, it is our duty to look after the environment so that future generations are not deprived of their needs. Sustainable agriculture helps to replenish the land as well as other natural resources such as water and air.
	It ensures Public Health SafetySustainable agriculture avoids hazardous pesticides and fertilizers. As a result, farmers are able to produce fruits, vegetables and other crops that are safer for consumers, workers, and surrounding communities. Through careful and proper management of livestock waste, sustainable farmers can protect humans from exposure to pathogens, toxins, and other hazardous pollutants.
	It Prevents Air Pollution Agricultural activities affect air quality by smoke from agricultural burning; dust from tillage, traffic and harvest; pesticide drift from spraying; and nitrous oxide emissions from the use of nitrogen fertilizer.
	Sustainable agriculture means that any waste a farm produces remains inside the farm’s ecosystem. In this way, the waste cannot cause pollution
	It Prevents Soil Erosion.Our continued ability to produce adequate food has been a serious threat to soil erosion. Therefore, numerous practices have been developed to keep soil in place, which includes reducing or eliminating tillage, managing irrigation to reduce runoff, and keeping the soil covered with plants.
	Its Beneficial For Environment Sustainable agriculture reduces the need for the use of nonrenewable energy resources and, as a result, benefits the environment
		<br><br>
	<h1>6. High Quality Seeds</h1><br>
	Recent research shows that smallholder farmers (who grow around 80 percent of the world’s total food) have very limited access to high quality seeds. This is a relatively simple problem to fix, as high quality seeds are fairly easy to come by. After a farmer acquires such seed, they can usually continue to reap benefits of high yield varieties for many years into the future, by saving and replanting the seeds that they harvest each season. 
		<br>7.Better Monitoring Technology</h1><br>
Farmers, particularly in developing countries, often don’t know exactly how much water and nutrients their plants need. These days, scientists have developed sensors that can easily detect a soil’s water and nutrient content, and thereby facilitate the efficient application of agricultural resources. 
	<br><br>

Such technology is particularly beneficial in areas where vital resources are in short supply. In such locations, resource scarcity can cause strife between farmers. Any technology capable of reducing resource waste can, therefore, improve relationships as well as profits.
	<h1>7. Cover Cropping</h1><br>
Cover cropping serves two primary purposes. The first is to prevent soil from eroding away from fields. This issue frequently arises when fields are left bare after harvest. With no roots holding the soil together, it is vulnerable to erosion driven by wind and water. However, if farmers plant a cover crop following the harvest of the primary cash crop, this issue is largely mitigated. The other primary goal of a cover crop is to reintroduce vital nutrients into the soil. The most important of these nutrients is nitrogen, which plants such as legumes can capture from the atmosphere through a symbiotic relationship with bacteria.

					<br><br>
	<h1>Intercropping / Polyculture</h1><br>
Monocropping, the practice of growing a single variety of crop on one large piece of land, is the most common form of agriculture in America. Though effective in some circumstances, monocropping can deplete the soil of nutrients, and does little to foster biodiversity. In an alternative system known as intercropping, farmers place several different species of plants in close proximity to one another. This arrangement boosts plant health and leads to the creation of symbiotic relationships between species. Many farmers include animals in the mix as well for pest control and fertilization. While intercropping is usually more labor intensive than monocropping, the per acre yield of an intercropped farm is often higher than of a farm that is monocropped.<br>
